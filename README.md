## Weather Prediction Project

In this group project, my group attempted to predict the temperature and precipitation in NYC. 

Among the models we tried, I utilized XGBoosting with regression tree modeling to attempt to predict temperature and precipitation. Here is my attempt, including feature selection, and feature engineering: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RdWQmtQvZIYiKnvJWQLvYuEWtl0eWTsW/view?usp=sharing

Here's our group report, https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t6uzn8V56CROHo5AaMm3lYYLP22NkjIgX-inGbUUO6E/edit?usp=sharing, where I wrote about the results of my model.
